        <h3 class="text-center">BBQ BACON BURGER</h3>
        <p> Our BBQ Bacon Burger features our special house ground blend of wagyu and sirloin, spiced perfectly, and finished off with just a drop of white truffle oil. A butter grilled brioche bun layered with roasted red onion, perfectly crispy pork belly, and our hickory smoked BBQ sauce.</p>
        <p>Our passion is beef! We use only Grade A Choice Chuck beef that we purchase in large slabs. The meat is fresh, never frozen. We butcher these slabs ourselves at our local commissary into the steaks like the ones shown in the image on the left. Our meat to fat ratio is perfect to deliver amazing flavor while being incredibly juicy, not greasy. We then take these steaks and grind them daily into one third pound meatballs that we send to each of our restaurants every morning.</p>
        <p>To ensure the freshest product you can eat, we don't start cooking your burger until you place your order. Once our experienced cooks see your order come through your patty goes on the grill. We have a patent-pending tool for bringing your patty to the correct thickness to ensure the most flavor. The burger is then given a perfect thin crust that holds in our seasoning while delivering to you a multi-dimensional taste. These burgers are the result of Mr. Bubbus nearly 60 years of experience as a master butcher. Our burgers have won multiple awards over the years and we are proud to be serving Central Arkansas. Our hope is that you enjoy them as much as we do!</p>

            <h3 class="text-center">GRILL CHEESE FRIES</h3>
            <p> We have the freshest fries around! We start with real potatoes that we hand cut throughout the day. Our process for making fries is both simple and complicated. It's simple because we have only three ingredients: potatoes, Canola oil and salt. The complex part is our process. We test the potatoes to ensure they have just the right amount of sugar. We then have a special process in the frying as they are dipped more than once in the Canola oil to lock in taste. Not only are these spuds addictive and delecious, but they're also endless!!</p>
            <p>All topping are cut fresh each day. Great care is taken to ensure quality. Our dedicated staff cut them by hand and inspect all produce before sending them out to our restaurants. We never use any chemicals to extend freshness. Our goal is always to provide produce that best supports our meat. </p>

            <h3 class="text-center">ABOUT US</h3>
            <p>Our restaurants are designed in the spirit of the butcher shops of the 1950's and 60's. This was a period of time when people really understood cuts of meat and embraced the quality of their products. Upon entering our restaurants you will see our butcher cases front and center. They display the meat that we cut and grind daily to produce the freshest, tastiest burgers you'll ever know. We keep a very simplistic menu to ensure that we stay focused on one thing, quality of our food. It's our hope that you will stop in and enjoy our award winning burgers. Look forward to seeing you! </p>
